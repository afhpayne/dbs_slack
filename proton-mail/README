Proton Mail

Proton Mail is the world’s largest end-to-end encrypted email service.
Proton Mail makes sure no one can access your emails by using
end-to-end encryption and zero-access encryption. All of Proton Mail’s
encryption happens in the background, meaning anyone can use encrypted
email, regardless of technical ability.

This installs official desktop application for Proton Mail and Proton
Calendar.

Microsoft Edge is a proprietary cross-platform web browser
created by Microsoft and based on the Chromium open-source
project, superseding Edge Legacy.

NOTE
Microsoft Edge requires /etc/machine-id in order to run.
If the browser fails to start, you may need to run this
command as root to create a symlink for the needed file.

ln -s /var/lib/dbus/machine-id /etc/machine-id

Spectrwm is a small dynamic tiling window manager for X11. It tries to stay out
of the way so that valuable screen real estate can be used for much more
important stuff. It has sane defaults and does not require one to learn a
language to do any configuration. It was written by hackers for hackers and it
strives to be small, compact and fast.

NOTES:
The installer includes several config files, namely:
baraction.sh (scripts for the status bar in Linux)
spectrwm.conf (a default configuration file)
spectrwm_$LANGUAGE.conf (language-specfic keyboard layouts)

All these files can be found in /usr/doc/spectrwm-$VERSION

spectrwm will look for
.spectrwm.conf and .spectrwm_us.conf in $HOME/user/
and baraction.sh in an executable path which can be specified in the config
